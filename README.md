This project uses  `Rails 4` and `Foundation 5`

`sqlite3`  (local db) and `Parse` (cloud db)

 *Ideally there would be a separate controller for books,
 but because book data only get pulled from cloud storage when requested,
 there is no need to create a set of views for books
 (query results displayed on the fly).*
