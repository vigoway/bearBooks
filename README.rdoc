This project uses Rails 4 and Foundation 5. <br/>
Sqlite (local db) and Parse (cloud db). <br/>
##Main file: app/controller/users_controller.rb

 Ideally there would be a separate controller for books,
 but because book data only get pulled from cloud storage when requested,
 there is no need to create a set of views for books
 (query results displayed on the fly).
